# MON14500 (PLC14500 Assembler and Monitor)

This replaces the regular bootloader and offers an interactive interface to play with the board from a serial terminal
and, of course, the bootloader function as before.

No documentation yet, this is all you get: connect with a terminal to the serial port (9600,n,8,1), wait for a banner
and press enter. You will be greeted by a prompt (a single `.`). Type "H" and enter and see a list of commands for
yourself.

If you encounter any issues and wish to revert back to the regular, and tested, bootloader you will find it in the 
`bootloader` folder in this repo, just transfer the sketch to the board with an Arduino IDE.

Comments and suggestions welcome, please use GitHub Discussions section.
