# PLC14500 Programmmers Guide

In this guide I will assume you are familiar with Ladder Logic diagram symbols. If these are new to you, I suggest you
first familiarize with the symbology. One good starting point is this
Wikipedia [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladder_logic).

I will also assume you have assembled and tested the board following the instructions in the [READ.me](../../README.md)
file.

## The Board

### Clock Modes

Before heading into the actual programming of the board, let's familiarize with the hardware. On the top side of
the board you have two switches labelled `HI/LO` and `RUN/STEP` respectively. These control the clock generator. In run
mode the clock runs freely and can be configured between two speeds. `HI` is the "normal" running speed, which is
suitable for running programs and see inputs and outputs being processed timely. `LO` is a 1Hz clock which is mostly
suitable for a majestic display of blinking lights. If you run your program at this clock speed remember you might need
to wait seconds between applying inputs and seeing the effects on the output so, generally, you won't use it for testing
purposes.

In `STEP` mode the clock generator is stopped, so `HI/LO` has no effect. You will be providing clock pulses by
pressing the `STEP` button. This mode is very useful for following your program step by step and seeing exactly how the
various registers change as instructions are executed.

On the board you will find the `RST` button. This resets the Program Counter to zero and also clears all outputs and
the `SPR` registers. It's always a good idea to press `RST` after uploading a new program, this will ensure the program
starts from a clean state and is not affected by the settings left by the previous one.

*Note* the Program Counter is reset to zero when you press `RST` but, due to the nature of the counter, you won't see
this relected in the `ADDR` bus until you `STEP` once.

### Inputs/Outputs

The board provides 7 "inputs". They are not actual external inputs but a combination of switch and button that can be
used to simulate an external "Normal Open" or "Normal Closed" switch or button. By moving the switch you can change the
input "normal" state to either on or off, as shown by the related LED on the board (`IN0-IN6`). The button always
negates the current status. So, for instance, if you set the switch so that the input in on, by pressing the button it
will go off.

Similarly, the board provides 7 outputs which are LEDs (`OUT0-OUT6`) that can be set on or off under software control.

### Onboard Timer

There is a timer onboard that can be set from a short, about 0.5s, duration to about 10s through `RV1`. This timer is
triggered by an additional output, not available as a general output (`OUT7`). The output of the timer is wired to an
input which also cannot be set like the others with the switch and button (`IN7`).

### Status LEDs

There is no shortage of LEDs on the board. The `ADDR` and `DATA` section show the status of the RAM Address and Data
bus. Here you can see the location in the program being executed and the actual instruction and its argument.

The `J`, `RR` and `W` LEDs show the internal status of registers in the MC14500. They are respectively Jump, which goes
high when a `JMP` instruction is executed; `RR` which contains the result of the last operation; `W` which goes high
when a `STO` instruction writes to the outputs.

The rest of the LEDs should be self-explanatory as they give a visual feedback on the status of the switches (such as)
`LO`, `HI`, `R` for `RUN` and `ST` for step.

## Reading Inputs and controlling outputs

In this first example we will be simply reading the status of one of the inputs and mirroring it to an output. A ladder
diagram for such application would look something like this:

![example_1](../documentation/ex1_load_and_store.png)

This can be translated to MC14500 assembly (with some extra code, we will get to that in a moment).

````
.board=PLC14500-Nano

IEN IN6
OEN IN6

LD  IN0
STO OUT0

JMP 0
````

The `.board` directive is metadata that serves the purpose to tell the assembler on which type of board we want to run
our code. This will have an effect on the generated bytecode as well as will provide relevant errors should some part
of the program make use of features not available in a certain board type.

The next two instructions `IEN` and `OEN` are the two intruders that don't appear in our ladder diagram. These
instructions
stand for `Input ENable` and `Output ENable`. They are a powerful construct that allows to build conditionals that, in
practice, surf over (skip) a block of code. But, for the time being, let's not digress into this. At this stage it's
enough to know that, after reset, the MC14500 "disables" its input and output or, in other words, ignores any actual
value read from the inputs and any write operation to the outputs. This is a bit unfortunate as it means we must have
such instructions in every program or the program would do nothing at all. For simplicity, we tell the MC14500 to
enable input/output operations on the status of input IN6, so we will need to make sure this is flipped to ON. This
is not how usually programs are written, as this wastes one input. However, for simplicity, the examples in this guide
will use this construct until logical operations are explained later.

The next two lines are the actual representation of our ladder diagram. The `LD` instruction will load the value of IN0
into the only register `RR`. After this, `STO` will store the value in `RR` into `OUT0` so, in practice, OUT0 will
reflect the status of `IN0`.

The last instruction `JMP 0`, jumps at the start of the program. **Note!** The PLC14500-Nano doesn't have a pre-settable
Program Counter, for this reason it allows jumping only to 0. The assembler will error if you try to do otherwise.
However, worry not, with the `IEN`/`OEN` instructions and the `SKZ` conditional there are plenty of options to have more
complex flows than just a single loop.

Let's go ahead and assemble the program. I'm assuming here you downloaded the release zip and unzipped it in a folder.

````
asm14500.exe examples\example1.asm
````

If you now look into the `examples` folder you should have a 256-bytes file named `example1.bin`. The file is 256 bytes
because that's what the bootloader of a PLC14500-Nano expects, your program is just 5 bytes long, the rest has been
padded with `0x0F`. You can see this with a binary editor:

````
Offset(h) 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F
00000000  EA EB 81 88 0C 0F 0F 0F 0F 0F 0F 0F 0F 0F 0F 0F  êë.ˆ............
000000E0  0F 0F 0F 0F 0F 0F 0F 0F 0F 0F 0F 0F 0F 0F 0F 0F  ................
.....
000000F0  0F 0F 0F 0F 0F 0F 0F 0F 0F 0F 0F 0F 0F 0F 0F 0F  ................
````

Before we can test the program on the board we will need to identify which COM port gets assigned to our board. Also,
ensure you followed the board assembly instructions and burned the bootloader into the Arduino Nano. The easiest way
to find out the right COM port is to open the Arduino IDE, open the `Tools\Port` menu and take a note of what ports
are available (possibly none), then plug in the PLC14500-Nano and check again `Tools\Port` to determine the new one
that appeared. In this guide I will assume `COM3`, adjust examples as needed.

Let's now load the assembled program to the board:

````
flash14500.cmd examples\example1.bin COM3
````

You should see the `ADDR` and `DATA` LEDs on the board flashing for a few seconds, wait the command to complete and then
press the `RST` button on the board to ensure it's running. Also make sure the two switches on top are set to `HI` and
`RUN` respectively. This ensures the clock is running at normal speed.

To test the program make sure `IN6` is switched to on (remember, this reflects the input/output enable of the MC14500),
if you now press momentarily the `IN0` button you will notice the `OUT0` LED will follow.

Go ahead and turn off `IN6`, now regardless of the state of `IN0` the `OUT0` will not change.

Congratulations! You wrote your first PLC14500 assembly program! In truth, it could be the second if you did the
smoke test in the assembly instructions, but this is the first one you, hopefully, understand.

## Logic operations

At this stage you might be thinking: surely that was a lot of soldering and typing to just get a LED controlled by a
button, I know how to do that with a button and a LED! And you are right, it gets worse though. The next example won't
change things much, it will show what you could do with two buttons and a LED. However, this will provide the foundation
for more advanced setups not achievable by wiring alone.

The MC14500 provides instructions to perform logical operations. All logical operations are performed between the `RR`
register value and the input value provided as argument. Below is an example program that will switch on `OUT0` only if
both `IN0` and `IN1` are on.

````
.board=PLC14500-Nano

IEN IN6
OEN IN6

LD  IN0
AND IN1
STO OUT0

JMP 0
````

This is actually very similar to the previous example, just with the addition of the `AND IN1` line. This command will
take the value currently in the `RR` register (`IN0` in this case) and do a logical `AND` with the value in `IN1`, the
result will be stored in `RR` and, on the next line, stored in `OUT0`.

If you assemble and load the program above you will notice you need to have both `IN0` and `IN1` on for `OUT0` to go on.

There's not much point in providing examples for other logical operations, there will be many occasions later on to use
them directly in various applications. I will just list below all logical operations provided by the MC14500 for
reference.

| Instruction |                   |
|-------------|-------------------|
| AND         | RR = D AND RR   |
| NAND        | RR = !Data AND RR |
| OR          | RR = Data OR RR   |
| ORC         | RR = !Data OR RR  |
| XNOR        | RR = !(Data XOR RR) |

## IEN/OEN

We've seen, out of necessity, `IEN` and `OEN` instructions above. In the examples so far both commands were just run at the
start of the program and the argument was always `IN6`. This is perfectly fine for many programs you might want to write
on your trainer board. However, not only this wastes one input, it also fails to make use of the instructions for their
intended purpose. To enable unconditionally inputs and outputs, as we do in these simple examples, you can do the following:

````
  ORC RR
  IEN RR
  OEN RR
````

`RR` refers to the result register of the MC14500 which is, conveniently, mapped as an input, so it can be addressed
by instructions as if it was an input/output. To understand this block of code, refer above to the `ORC` operation in the table above. This is
an `OR` operation between the value in `RR` and the complement of whatever is currently on the `RR` input which, of course,
is `RR` itself. This means that, regardless of the value of `RR` we will always be making an `OR` operation between the
value and its negation, ie always between a `0` and a `1`, hence the result will always be `1`.

If you really want to dive deeper, you might think this is faulty because, on reset, inputs are disabled so the `ORC`
wouldn't be able to read `RR`. This is true, however, at reset `RR` is initialized to `0`, and reading an input when
inputs are disabled reads always a zero. For this reason, at reset, we will still be making an `OR` between `0` (`RR`)
and the complement of the read input, which will result in a `1`.

**NOTE** Boards up to REV.B (included) didn't have RR mapped to the I/O space and, for this reason, were not able to 
use `IEN`/`OEN` instructions driven by the application status, as described here. If you have a `REV.B` board you can easily enable this 
functionality with a simple mod. See instructions in the [/board](../board) folder. If you don't wish to modify your 
board, please keep using the `IEN IN6`/`OEN IN6` construct also in the code in the next sections. You will not be able,
however, to follow more advanced techniques to create `IF`/`ELSE`/`ENDIF` blocks.

## Latch and Reset

With the next example things will start to get more interesting and will move a step further from something that can be
achieved by just wiring buttons and LEDs. From here I will start also to introduce the examples in terms of real life
applications instead of abstract "the output will be on when this and that happens".

For this example we will consider a common scenario in industrial machines where we have a motor controlled by two
buttons,
one to start it and one to stop it.

I will take the occasion of our first real-life scenario, to digress and introduce a feature of the assembler that will
make your programs easier to understand and maintain. The assembler metadata allows to provide friendly names for the
inputs and outputs of the board, these names can then be used throughout the code instead of the input/output names.
This
will not only make the code much easier to read and understand, it will also allow to change the inputs/outputs assigned
to each function a breeze with no risk to forget to change them somewhere in the code.

Friendly names are declared in the assembly file like this:

````
.io_SWITCH_A=IN0
.io_SWITCH_B=IN1
.io_MOTOR=OUT0
````

This will then allow us to use them throughout the code like:

````
LD SWITCH_A
AND SWITCH_B
STO MOTOR
````

We will see a practical usage soon, but before we can implement our machine control buttons there's one more notion I
need
to introduce which is the Scratchpad RAM (`SPR` in short). The `SPR` is composed of 8 bits mapped as inputs and outputs
where the outputs are always looped back to their respective inputs. In other words, if you write something to `SPR0`
you
can read it back later on in the program. This is not true for `IN` and `OUT` that are not looped back (writing a value
in `OUT0` doesn't affect `IN0`, as one would expect.). The `SPR` is useful to store values we want to persist and use
in different parts of our program.

The ladder diagram for an industrial motor start/stop control would look like this:

![example_3](../documentation/ex3_latch.png)

`START` is our start button and `STOP` the stop button. `MOTOR` is, you guessed it, the motor. Things get interesting
with `RUN`. This is not an actual button or actuator, this represents what you would achieve with a relay. When the coil
of the hypothetical `RUN` relay is energized the `RUN` contactor would be closed. This, in practice, will keep energized
the `RUN` relay coil even when `START` is released. This allows us to achieve one of the goals: latch `RUN` when `START`
is pressed. The `STOP` button (normally closed), will de-energize `RUN` when pressed and, as a consequence, reset the
latch
completing the needed functionality. The bottom rung in the ladder simply applies the `RUN` contactor to the motor.

As you might have guessed by now, `RUN` is neither an input nor an output, it's just a value we need to store and, as
we just learned, the `SPR` is there exactly for this purpose. The code below implements the described start/stop logic.

````
.board=PLC14500-Nano
.io_START=IN0
.io_STOP=IN1
.io_RUN=SPR0
.io_MOTOR=OUT0

ORC  RR
IEN  RR
OEN  RR

LD   START
OR   RUN
ANDC STOP
STO  RUN

STO  MOTOR

JMP  0
````

I won't go into too much detail of the code as the operations are like those described previously. What is to be noted
is the usage of `RUN` (which is a label for `SPR0`) to store the status of the motor. If you assemble and load this
program you will notice that when you press `IN0` the output `OUT0` will go high. Take a moment to look at the `SPR0`
LED as well and notice how it also goes on. Pressing again `IN0` (`START`) doesn't to anything, however
pressing `IN1` (`STOP`) will switch off `OUT0` (`MOTOR`) as well as `SPR0`.

Now that you have a bit more complex program take a moment to familiarize with the step of moving from a ladder diagram
to the assembly code. You might have jumped on the chair when, above, I said "and this ladder diagram can be written as
this program", I won't blame you. However, if you look closely at the first rung `START` and `RUN` are in parallel, this
means they are passing current if one OR the other is on (`LD START` `OR RUN`). Moving towards the right of that same
rung we see that current flowing though `START` or `RUN` can't reach the `RUN` coil if `STOP` is pressed (it's a Normal
Close contact), so we need `ANDC STOP` (if stop is on, ie pressed, we will do an AND with the complement which is off,
this will always result in off, regardless of the status of `START` and `RUN`).

With a bit of exercise you should be able to read the ladder diagram from top to bottom and type accordingly the
assembly code.

## Using the timer

PLC14500-Nano comes with one analog onboard timer. The timer (`TMR-0`) can be triggered with a high pulse on `OUT7`. The
output of the timer output can be read on `IN7`. Once the timer is triggered, `IN7` will go high for a time that can be
set with `RV1`, after this time has elapsed `IN7` will go back to low until the timer is triggered again.

We can use the timer to implement, for instance, the controller for a set of lights on the staircase of a block of
flats. We will assume 4 buttons, one per floor. The desired behaviour is that which ever button is pressed will cause
the lights to turn on and, after a preset time the lights will go off.

````
.board=PLC14500-Nano

.io_BUTTON_A=IN0
.io_BUTTON_B=IN1
.io_BUTTON_C=IN2
.io_BUTTON_D=IN3
.io_LIGHT=OUT0

ORC  RR
IEN  RR
OEN  RR

LD   BUTTON_A
OR   BUTTON_B
OR   BUTTON_C
OR   BUTTON_D

STO  OUT7

LD   IN7
STO  LIGHT

JMP  0
````

The buttons handling should be clear by now, we just load each button status and OR it into a final status that we use
to trigger `TMR-0` (by storing it in `OUT7`). We then store into `LIGHT` the status of `IN7`, which is the timer output.

If you load this program you will notice that by pressing any buttons `IN0`-`IN3` will cause `OUT0` to become high.
After a time, dependent on the setting of `RV1`, `OUT0` will go off.

## I/O Map

Below is the PLC14500-Nano I/O map.

![io_map](../documentation/PLC14500-Nano_IO_Map.png)

*NOTE:* Before REV.C, $7 was a general Scratchpad RAM location and the board provided no means to read RR. Having RR 
mapped to an input allows to unleash the full power of IEN/OEN operations.  If you have a pre REV.C board fear not! 
You can enable the same feature with a very simple mod, see instructions in the [/board](../board) folder.

## Next Steps

Given the nature of the board I won't include more examples in this guide as, I believe, most will build this for the
fun of writing new programs and figure out things on their own. The above should have provided enough info to
familiarize with elements specific to the board and toolchain.

I suggest you get familiar with the Motorola "MC14500B Industrial Control Unit Handbook" that provides a plethora of
information on the processor itself and on its programming model. In particular, you can find there sections on how
to implement conditionals and how to unleash all the power of the `IEN`/`OEN` instructions for conditional loops. 

Some ideas of programs you might want to try to write, in no particular order:

* Motorized gate with limit switches on open/closed and an obstruction sensor that will cause the gate to re-open.
* A two floors goods lift, with UP/DOWN buttons, sensors to ensure the doors are closed and floor switches
* A motor START/STOP controller with an over-current protection switch that will prevent restarting the motor for a
  certain time if triggered
* A delayed on timer for a bathroom fan, so that the fan only starts after some delay after the lights are on and keeps running for some time after the lights have been switched off
