;
; Kill the bit for PLC14500-Nano (with slower clock).
;
; NOTE! This game requires a REV.B or later board with R30 replaced with a 10K. This is
;   because the clock needs to be slowed down for the game to humanly playable. If you
;   feel inclined, you could replace R30 with a 10K trimmer instead, so you can tune the
;   game speed.
;
; The game idea itself is from a game for the Altair by Dean McDaniel in 1975.
; Original Description:
;   Object: Kill the rotating bit. If you miss the lit bit, another
;   bit turns on leaving two bits to destroy. Quickly
;   toggle the switch, don't leave the switch in the up
;   position. Before starting, make sure all the switches
;   are in the down position.
;
; The idea to implement it on the MC14500 came to me after watching this awesome
;   build by Usagi Electric: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=md_cPxVDqeM
;   Also the code was heavily adapted from this one:
;   https://github.com/veremenko-y/mc14500-programs/blob/main/sbc1/killthebit.s
