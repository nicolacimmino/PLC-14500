These examples are suitable for REV.B boards because they rely on an input (usually IN6) to drive the 
IEN and OEN instructions. This is due to the inability of an unmodified REV.B to read RR as an input.

If you have followed the instructions to modify your REV.B board to match REV.C (where RR is mapped
to the I/O space), you can run either this version of the examples of the ones in the parent folder (and
save IN6 for other uses).
